Website for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@cryobyte33), hosted at [cryobyte.io](https://cryobyte.io).

Built with Hugo!

## Contribution
I don't expect any contribution here, but if you see a typo or something, I'll be happy to take a look at it ðŸ™‚

## Structure
All content is in `content/`, with new "posts" being in `content/posts`.

## Building
Done automatically on merge, but `huge --minify` will build manually, and `hugo serve -D` will host locally for testing.
