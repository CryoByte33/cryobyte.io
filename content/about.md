My name is CryoByte33, or Kyle. I'm a 30-year-old DevOps Engineer who lived in GÃ¶teborg Sweden with 
my wife Crystal, and our dog Rose. We've recently moved back to the US, and I just love to help people game a bit better!

I've been using Linux for about 18 years now, and have been coding for 13. My hobbies are _mostly_ tech-related:
* Gaming
* Tinkering
* 3D Printing
* Development/Coding
* Coffee/Fika
* Self-Hosting/Homelab
* Reading

Most recently, I've been dead-set on the Steam Deck! I have a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@cryobyte33) 
where I do very technical Steam Deck content, with the main goals being to educate and enhance performance.
