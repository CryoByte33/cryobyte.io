My name is CryoByte33, or Kyle. I'm a 29-year-old, American-born, DevOps Engineer who lives in GÃ¶teborg Sweden with 
my wife Crystal, and our dog Rose.

I've been using Linux for about 18 years now, and have been coding for 13. My hobbies are _mostly_ tech-related:
* Gaming
* Tinkering
* 3D Printing
* Development/Coding
* Coffee/Fika
* Self-Hosting/Homelab
* Reading

Most recently, I've been dead-set on the Steam Deck! I have a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@cryobyte33) 
where I do very technical Steam Deck content, with the main goals being to educate and enhance performance.
