Hey guys, I decided to make my first fancy video a Steam Deck unboxing and first impressions, but it ended up being 
quite the process.

I REALLY like it and can't wait to get more time with it, see the video for a full first look.

Note: This was recorded after a week-long cold where I was still stuffy, my recording setup was absolutely horrid, and 
I learned to edit the day after a massive party when my head was still pounding ðŸ™ƒ Regardless, I like the result and 
decided I should share it anyway.

The next video will be better, I promise!
