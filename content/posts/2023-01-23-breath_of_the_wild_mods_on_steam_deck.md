Here's the companion video to the Deck Dive, a shorter video that explains how to install mods for Breath of the Wild 
on the Steam Deck!

It's a little tricky because you can't use the built-in Python and need to use a few different tools, but this should 
help anyone out who wants an excuse to play in Hyrule again 😁

Let me know if you like this shorter-form content, or if you'd like more how-to's!
