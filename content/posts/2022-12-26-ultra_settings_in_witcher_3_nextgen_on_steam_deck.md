After 2 long weeks of sleepless nights, the Witcher 3 Next-Gen Update Deck Dive is complete! I think the results 
speak for themselves, and I hope you like the surprises in-store!

Update: There's a small typo in my Golden 40 title where it still says "Sexy 30", but the preset is still correct, sorry!
