Hey everyone!

Today is a big day, I've uploaded a MASSIVE update to CryoUtilities with a ton of new features for performance and saving storage space!

Huge shout-out to my wife Crystal for the art, and for putting up with me working all day, every day, for almost 2 months to pull this one off.

Lastly, an extra huge shout-out to my patrons for allowing me to spend so much time doing this, and for beta testing!

I hope you guys enjoy the video and the new update!
