Hey guys!

This video is a little different, as you know. I'm trying my hand at reviewing products, but with the CryoByte33 
technical mindset.

This video took a little longer because I was waiting for nice weather to get some good B-Roll, but it never happened so you get gameplay sometimes instead ðŸ˜…
